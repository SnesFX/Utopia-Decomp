# Sonic Utopia Nintendo Switch Port

* This branch was made for my Sonic Utopia Nintendo Switch Port which is based off of my decompilation.

* You can download the port from the releases page of [this repo](https://github.com/SnesFX/Utopia-Switch-Builds/tree/main)

# Requirements (to build)

* [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) - USE THIS TO DOWNLOAD/CLONE BECAUSE OF GIT LFS STUFF

* If the Above doesn't work use [This](https://www.mediafire.com/file/8b5phxhdbs21y37/Utopia+Decomp+Backup.zip/file) instead. MAKE SURE TO READ THE README.

* [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download)
